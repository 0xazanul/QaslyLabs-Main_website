# The Integration of SAST and DAST: A Comprehensive Approach to Security

In the security landscape, two major approaches have traditionally been used to identify vulnerabilities in applications: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). Each has its strengths and limitationsâ€”but what happens when we combine them?

## Understanding SAST vs DAST

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** analyzes source code without executing it, identifying potential vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. It's comprehensive but can produce false positives.

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** tests running applications by simulating attacks, finding vulnerabilities that only appear during execution. While highly accurate, it typically happens later in development.

## The Power of Integration

At Qasly Labs, we've pioneered an integrated approach that leverages the strengths of both methodologies:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: SAST identifies potential issues in all code paths, while DAST verifies exploitability in runtime environments.

2. **Reduced False Positives**: By correlating SAST findings with DAST results, we significantly reduce false positives, allowing teams to focus on verified issues.

3. **Continuous Security**: Our platform implements both techniques throughout the development lifecycle, from early coding stages to production monitoring.

4. **Contextual Intelligence**: The combined approach provides deeper understanding of vulnerabilities by linking code-level issues to runtime behaviors.

## Implementation in Practice

Our system begins with SAST analysis during code development, identifying potential issues as developers write code. These findings are then validated through automated DAST testing in staging environments.

In production, continuous DAST monitoring provides real-time threat detection, with results feeding back into the SAST engine to improve future code analysis.

## Results

Organizations implementing our integrated approach have seen:

- 78% reduction in time-to-remediation
- 91% decrease in false positives
- 63% increase in vulnerability detection rates

By breaking down the traditional barriers between static and dynamic analysis, Qasly Labs offers a truly comprehensive security solution that protects applications throughout their entire lifecycle.
